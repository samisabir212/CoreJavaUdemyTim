make sure only baseball players are in baseball teams
    same goes for every other sport and team
        the sport = team sport



Team class , create Type parameter
    modify the class declaration to include the top parameter
    use a diamond and put a T in the middle which indicates its going to be a type parameter


An arguement passed for a type parameter can be either a class or an interface
