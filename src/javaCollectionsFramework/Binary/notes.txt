binary search is the fasted way to find an item in a sorted list
    works by checking the element in the mid point of the list
        method basically plays higher or lower with the list
        so the middle element is greater than the item that we're looking for
        then it knws the one we want must be in the first part of the list
        then perfoms a binary search on that half of the list in the same way soo
        the list is reduced to half each time.. will take no more than 10 chcks to find
        an item or decide its not present in a list of 1,023 elements 2 the power of 10
        1 million elements can be check in no more than 20 comparisons
        64 comparisons are all thats required to search a list With an Absolutly huge number
