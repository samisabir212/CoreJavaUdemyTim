sets are used less often than lists and maps but are extremely useful

a list is an ordered collection of items that can contain duplicates
    a set has no definied ordering
    a set cannot contain duplicates

theyre are ordered sets
    such as link hash set and tree set

to insure there is no dupicates in your new collection
    use set rather than list
        the set interface is generic and takes a single type
