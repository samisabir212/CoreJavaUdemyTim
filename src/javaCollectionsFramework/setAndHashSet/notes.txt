Set is a type of collection that stores unique elements

sets are used less often than lists and maps but are extremely useful

Hashsets do not retain order
    can and spontainiously rearrange them selves

LinkedHashset
    remembers order you added items in

Treeset
    stores in natural order (Alphabetic order)

a list is an ordered collection of items that can contain duplicates
    a set has no definied ordering
    a set cannot contain duplicates

theyre are ordered sets
    such as link hash set and tree set

to insure there is no dupicates in your new collection
    use set rather than list
        the set interface is generic and takes a single type


sets are optimized to find a particular item quikly
    unlike arraylist you have itarate through the whole list
        Sets asks if an item is contained in the list


to find whats common between two different sets
    use retainAll() method


you can pass a constructor when creating a new set
    its making a copy when you pass another set in in another set

to find the difference between two sets
    use removeAll() method and pass set 2 as parameter
        you will be left with just set1 elements and not set2 elements
