 linkedhashmaps are in order

 hashmaps are chaotic

 example in this project is adding items to shapping basket
 after choosing them from the list of all the items on sale
    maintain two collections
        1- a list of items that are in stock
        2- items that a customer added to the basket

we want to have stock items in alphabetic order
    we could have items come from a database
    so they could be at any order we want by using an order
    clauce and sql query retrieving from database
        this is a potantial way of doing it

lets see how a linked hash map can be useful
    we will extend it to use a tree map
