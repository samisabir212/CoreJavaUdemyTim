Please view Map.java class for further information

Map is not part of a collection
its an interface
maps keys to values
example of a map with the keys being in words in the dictionaries and
values being of course the definition of the words
a map cannot contian duplicate keys and each key can only map to a single value
 we will also look at Hash Map as well as Linked Hash Map
 also Tree Map that implements the sorted map interface

 use hash maps to store descriptions

 Maps come from the java.util package
    Maps are a inbuilt java interface

use the put method to add value to a key

you retrieve the key map with the get method
    and type in the key
