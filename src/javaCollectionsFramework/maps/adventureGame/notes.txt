creating a map of exits
using the locationID and description

Exit map is being initialized as a Hash Map with a key of String and a value of Integer

create getters for the location id
    description
    and map of exits

you need method for abilty to add an exit
    direction is going to be the key
    location is going to be our value

notice our fields our marked final so they cant be changed once a
concstructor has finished creating a location instance


the getExits() method is instead of just returning of exits map
and creating a new Hashmap and passing out exits in the constructor
 a new map is created and has all the mappings of the exit map
 nothing in the outside of that class can change exits,
 the getter returns a copy of exits so if the calling program wants to
 add or remove mappings from it and the exits mapping field wont be affected

 we will sho some ways t omake your classes immutable and returning immutable object to getter


in the main class
    we are passing an integer in the map and passing the location class as the value and the integer is the key
    initializing line 13

the while loop is using loc field set to 1 and iterating through the map to retrieve the description of each key

line 35 loc = scanner.nextInt() is retrieveng the number

mapping out the availble exits on line 30
    we have nort west south east as valid directions


instead of reading from integer we will read from the letter in the maps

line 68 creating a map of exits and using the getExits method to retrieve the exit getting the location number
    inittializing the LocationNUmber integer at Zero
    using the keyset() method in the forloop

grabing a letter rather than a number with the scanner

String direction = scanner.nextLine.touppercase

using the containsKey method on line 77

created valid keys for each location  on the map

REMEMBER
    the location number is returning the OBJECT


string class split method
